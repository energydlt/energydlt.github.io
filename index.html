EnergyDLT: ACM SIGEnergy Workshop on Energy Efficiency and Applications of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology
</p>

<p>
Blockchain and DLT are a disruptive paradigm to enable trustless decentralized verifiable applications. There are an increasing number of applications of blockchain technology to energy systems. For example, micro-payment for peer-to-peer EV charging, microgrid exchange and wholesale energy markets, renewable energy credits and emissions trading, and energy resource sharing and management. Besides their popularity, blockchain platforms (particularly, Bitcoin) suffer from significant energy consumption (overtaking all other areas in the IT sector). In this workshop, we aim to explore the potential applications of blockchain and DLT to energy systems, as well as addressing its energy efficiency issue.

ACM eEnergy is a premier conference for the interdisciplinary research in energy systems and computer systems. Given the popularity and significance of blockchain and DLT nowadays, this workshop is an ideal venue to gather researchers within or outside ACM SIGEnergy for broad energy related topics of blockchain and DLT.
