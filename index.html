                    <p class="lead">Blockchain and DLT are a disruptive paradigm to enable trustless decentralized verifiable applications. There are an increasing number of applications of blockchain technology to energy systems. For example, micro-payment for peer-to-peer EV charging, microgrid exchange and wholesale energy markets, renewable energy credits and emissions trading, and energy resource sharing and management. Besides their popularity, blockchain platforms (particularly, Bitcoin) suffer from significant energy consumption (overtaking all other areas in the IT sector). 
					</p>
					
				<p class="lead">In this workshop, we aim to explore the potential applications of blockchain and DLT to energy systems, as well as to address its energy efficiency issue. This workshop is organized through invited talks of well-known academics and practitioners. The second part of the workshop will be panel discussions of hot topics. It is held in conjunction with <a href="https://energy.acm.org/conferences/eenergy/2022/">ACM e-Energy 2022 conference</a>, and organized by <a href="https://energy.acm.org">ACM SIGEnergy</a> (Special Interest Group on Energy Systems and Informatics).

						<h2>Blockchain-enabled Security Systems for Smart Grids</h2>
                        <h3>Zhao Yang Dong<span>Nanyang Technological University</span></h3>
						<p>As cyber-attacks such as supply chain and false data injection attacks on smart grids remain a major challenge, blockchain technology has emerged as an attractive solution for enabling smart grid security due to its transparency, immutability, and decentralisation characteristics. These attacks focus on compromising smart grid components, services, and operations. In this project, we propose blockchain-enabled security systems to mitigate smart grid cyber-attacks and further facilitate automated security agreements across the value chain of the smart grids. We analyse the security of our systems, and the results show that security resilience is achieved. Furthermore, we implemented a prototype of our supply chain system on the Ethereum blockchain and evaluated it for real-world smart grid supply chain attacks.</p>

						<h2>DLT Meets Energy - Current & Future Perspectives</h2>
                        <h3>Ümit Cali<span>Norwegian University of Science and Technology</span></h3>
						<p>
						Modern power systems are evolving towards decarbonization and digitalization phases leading to Transactive Energy Systems (TES). Application of emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to develop a TES is not an unheard topic of research. The joint operation of AI  and DLT is providing various new opportunities and business models where smart contracts can play an enabler role to amalgamate interconnected systems like power systems and digital infrastructure and services. Furthermore, the current global environmental and political climate accentuates the need for clean energy sources combined with the need for deregulation, decentralization, decarbonization, digitalization, and democratization in the energy ecosystem. This workshop aims to demystify the potential of AI and DLT as enabler technologies for the Digital Green Transition of the energy industry from a TES perspective.

						<h2>Bringing Trust to Carbon Credits Through Computer Science</h2>
                        <h3>Srinivasan Keshav<span>University of Cambridge</span></h3>
						<p>
						Carbon credits--especially those derived from nature-based solutions such as reforestation or averted deforestation--are deservedly viewed as being untrustworthy and their use by airlines and oil companies a barely-concealed form of greenwashing. In this talk, I will present a solution to these issues that leverages advances in earth observation, AI, cloud storage, and blockchain. This solution is being prototyped by the Cambridge Center for Carbon Credits (https://4c.cst.cam.ac.uk ) and I will discuss the current status and our vision for the future.

						<h2>Programmable Energy</h2>
                        <h3>Jos Röling<span>IBM Consulting</span></h3>
						<p>
						In this talk I will share how the blockchain projects over the last 6 years in Energy have transformed into energy tokenization projects that I have done at IBM and at the not-for-profit 2tokens.org energy track. This collection of expertise has led to the “Programmable Energy” concept that brings together all lessons learned, to support the Energy Transition globally and the required acceleration in Europe by the REPowerEU program
